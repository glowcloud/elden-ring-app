# Elden Ring Companion 

A website collecting information about various items, bosses, locations, etc. from the video game Elden Ring. Allows for crafting your own builds through choosing character attributes and equipment.

Created with [React](https://react.dev/), [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) and [MUI](https://mui.com/). Uses an [external API](https://docs.eldenring.fanapis.com/docs/) for game info 
and [a custom backend](https://github.com/glowcloud/elden-ring-app-backend), built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com), for user and builds data.
